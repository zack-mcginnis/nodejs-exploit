# nodejs-exploit
This project will demonstrate how an imported npm package, acting as Express middleware, can spawn a child process and execute arbitrary commands sent from an attacker. The result of the executed command will be sent back to the client in the http response.

## To start
- `npm install` in both `server` and `exploit`.
- `npm start` in `server`
- Construct a GET request with a header called `secret` containing the value `testP@ss123`
- Send GET request to `http://localhost:3000/` with your desired command set as a query string param (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/?cmd=ls ~`)
- Inspect http response
